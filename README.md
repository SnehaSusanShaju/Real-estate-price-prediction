# Real-estate-price-prediction
Description: 
Completed a comprehensive data science project series that guided through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction model. Leveraged the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com.

Key Concepts Covered:
Data Preprocessing:Data loading and cleaning for dataset preparation.
Outlier detection and removal to enhance model accuracy.
Feature engineering to extract valuable insights from the data.
Utilized dimensionality reduction techniques to improve model efficiency.
Employed gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Executed k-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation.

Technologies and Tools Used:
Python for project implementation.
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib for creating visualizations.
Sklearn for building the predictive model.
Machine Learning model-Linear Regression

Guidance Source: Completed the project under the guidance of a data science tutorial series on Codebasics.

Personal Contribution: Actively implemented each stage of the project, ensuring thorough understanding of the techniques applied.
